# electionAnalysis
## Project Overview:
A Colorado Board of Elections employee requested that certain data be taken from the entire voting pool in a recent congressional election.  With tasks at hand the plan was to conduction calculations to determine the names of the candidates in the election, the percentage of votes each candidate obtained, the percentages of votes and of course the winner of the election.  Here is the summary of data extracted:

1 Calculate the total number of votes cast
2 List the names of all candidates
3 Calculate the total number of votes for each candidate
4 Calculate the percentage of total votes for each candidate
5 List the winner of the election

## Resources 
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code, 1.562

### Summary
The analysis of the election data has provided results to depict:
 - The total number of all votes cast
 - A comprehensive list of 3 candidates
 - CandidateX with y% of the vote and z number of votes
 - The information of the name of the winner of the election the percentage and the number of votes is then output into a text file.

## Challenge Overview

Compared to Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), Python seems to be a bit easier and a lot less clunky to utilize.  Python seems more streamlined and user friendly to put together.  Saying that, it was nice that VBA was much more forgiving in that the capital letters and indenting didn't matter.  With Python, it really matters on how far indented the code is placed within the program.  I learned that the hard way as I encountered an error and took a bit of time trying to figure out why my code was typed out exactly as suggested in the module, however it wasn't working.  I came to find out that the indent wasn't following the right loop!  I took out a tabbed indent and voila!  I love that I'm starting to get a better sense of how I may provide code through different interpreters, utilizing different sytles, and thinking through challenging problems.  As I've stated to my tutor, the more I do this the better I become.  Through this course I'm discovering that I may be a closet software engineer, as I'm really starting to enjoy this coding bit.

## Challenge Summary

This week's challenge summary was practical and not too difficult to understand.  I enjoyed pulling the nuggets out of the supplied dataset and creating the data to provide the analysis.  I believe this exercise is a very meaningful and useful way of obtaining a comprehensive data summary for any company.  I also appreciate the real-life scenarios that the module depicts.  It's quite helpful to assign these types of tasks as we try to understand, churn and, in turn, display valuable information to meet the demands of the week.
